Serum scans this directory and its subdirectories recursively, so you may have the page hierarchy as wide as you want, and as deep as you want.<p>Currently only two types of source files are supported by Serum: Markdown and HTML. The name of all markdown file must end with <code class=inline>.md</code> and the name of all HTML file must end with <code class=inline>.html</code>, as Serum determines source type by examining filename extensions. Although almost all HTML files are accepted by markdown processor, it is recommended to save HTML documents as HTML file because the extra procedure of markdown processing can be skipped.<p>For successful build, you need to provide metadata in the first line of every page source files. This special one line is neither processed by the markdown processor nor displayed on web browsers, but it can be used to set text displayed in the title bar of web browsers. The first line of each source file must contain a pound sign and a space (<code class=inline>&quot;# &quot;</code>) at the very beginning of the line, and the title of the page after those two characters. Below is an example of valid page source file.<pre><code class=lang-markdown># Welcome to My Website

... contents (in markdown or HTML) ...</code></pre></div></article></main><hr><footer><p>Copyright &copy; 2017 Dalgona. <a href=https://dalgona.github.io/ >[Website]</a> <a href=https://github.com/Dalgona>[GitHub]</a><p>This website was generated by <a href=https://github.com/Dalgona/Serum>Serum</a>.</footer></div><script src=/Serum/assets/js/prism.js></script>
